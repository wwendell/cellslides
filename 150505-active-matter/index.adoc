==== Particles in the cytoplasm diffuse much faster when the cell is metabolically active, by a factor of \(\sim 5-10 \)

== Can metabolic “noise” lead to  a difference in dynamics?

* Cells are active, non-equilibrium systems
* Chemical reactions are constantly consuming energy
* *Do these reactions raise the effective temperature?*

== Studying Active Matter

* Active matter is an ongoing field of research

* Much of it is concerned with studying bird flocks, fish schools, and bacterial swarms

* Particles are usually *responsive* and *directed*

[discrete]
==== *Active Matter* is composed of self-driven units, active particles, each capable of converting stored or ambient free energy into systematic movement [cite:marchetti_hydrodynamics_2013]

== Janus Particles

 * *Half* of each particle is coated with platinum, which catalyzes latexmath:[2 \mathrm{H_2 O_2 \rightarrow 2 H_2 O + O_2}] on only one side
 * This reaction pushes the particles asymmetrically due to the local osmotic pressure gradient [cite:howse_2007]

* Particles in H~2~O~2~ move much farther

\[
   \begin{align*}
   MSD(t) &= \left< \Delta \vec r^2 \right>\\
   &= \left< \vec r(t)^2 - \vec r(0)^2 \right>
   \end{align*}
\]

== Persistent Motion

* Self-propelling particles are typically modeled with "persistent motion": propulsion along some axis of the particle
* In eukaryotic cells, molecular motors are known to cause cytoplasm "mixing"
* This mechanism is not expected to exist in E. coli

== Simulating Metabolism

* Langevin thermostat
\[
    \vec F = -\vec \nabla U - \gamma \vec v + \vec \Gamma_T + \vec \Gamma_k\left(t\right)
\]
** WCA potential / repulsive Lennard-Jones for \(U\)
** Damping \(\gamma\) to simulate solution viscosity
** Random, instantaneous "kicks" to the particles
** \(\vec \Gamma_T\) for the thermostat; balanced by \(\gamma\)
** \(\vec \Gamma_k\) for metabolism

== Biological Considerations

* Metabolic activity does not significantly raise the temperature of the cell (right?)
* ATP, the main energy source of metabolism, has energy \(E_\mathrm{ATP} \sim 20 k_B T\)
* Metabolic activity would not have a rotational orientation

== Random Kicks

* The thermostat gives random kicks, \(\Gamma_T \sim \Delta t k_B T \sim {10}^{-5} k_B T\)

* Metabolism kicks are \(0 \le E_k \le 20 k_B T\), instantaneous, and uncorrelated

[discrete]
=== With Activity
|==================================

== Considerations

[horizontal]
 \(\phi\):: the packing fraction
 \(T_0\):: the thermostat temperature
 \(\gamma\):: the thermostat damping rate
 \(E_k\):: the kick magnitude
 \(f_k\):: the kick frequency
* If \(f_k E_k \ll \gamma T_0\), then the thermostat can keep \(T \sim T_0\)

== Simulation

* \(f\) is the kick _frequency_, _T_ is the measured _temperature_
* Kicks that are too frequent raise the temperature

== Simulation, Larger Kicks

image::randkicktest-MSD-f0.62-R200.svg[MSDs with Activity, 70%, title="", caption="", align=center]

* \(f\) is the kick _frequency_, _T_ is the measured _temperature_
* Kicks that are too frequent raise the temperature
